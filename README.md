# Overview

This is a simple Request Header Parser Microservice built with Node.js and Express. It parses the incoming request headers and returns a JSON response containing the requester's IP address, preferred language(s), and software information extracted from the User-Agent string.

## About

This project was completed as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Backend Development and APIs curriculum. It helped me practice working with Express, HTTP headers, and how to extract useful client information from requests.
